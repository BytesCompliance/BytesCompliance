# OpenDataology Governance

The OpenDataology project provides content (standards, data, code and documentation) that helps organizations, especially AI enterprises, use open datasets compliantly.

A project of this scope requires input from a wide range of subject matter experts with different backgrounds and allegiances.
As such we need a set of principles, roles and operating practices to ensure the results of our contributions are useful,
have high quality and are widely consumable.

## General principles

Anyone can contribute to OpenDataology on any of our repos. See [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how to participate. 

## OpenDataology community members

Anyone can become a member of the OpenDataology community by joining the slack community, attending the project online meetings
or contributing content to one of more of the GitHub repositories.

The [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how to connect to these channels.

All participants in the OpenDataology community are bound by the project's
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

As a member you are able to attend our meetings, just to listen, or to play an active part in the discussion.
The online meetings are recorded to allow community members to catch up if they are not able to attend the live meeting.
When you attend the community meetings specifically, your name will be recorded in the meeting minutes along with any remarks or suggestions you make.
The agenda and minutes of our community meetings are publicly available on the Slack channel, You can join the channel by click the [Link](https://join.slack.com/t/dataset-license/shared_invite/zt-1823jgzvb-3ExLy22G4fKSaTYdXb9fYQ).

A member may make contributions to the OpenDataology content by submitting a
GitHub pull request on the appropriate Git repository.
This will be reviewed and processed by the **OpenDataology committers**.

Each contribution is signed by the contributor to confirm they
agree to our [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](what-is-the-dco.md).

Community members can progress to be **OpenDataology Contributors** and then **OpenDataology Committers**.

### OpenDataology contributors

OpenDataology contributors are members who have actively taken additional steps to promote and foster the success of OpenDataology and its acceptance/adoption across the IT community. The activities that contributors engage in might include:

* Provide best practices for Open Data compliance and other related fields
* Actively participate in meetings and discussions
* Promote the goals of OpenDataology and the benefits of open data compliance to the community (deliver presentations, informal talks, assist at trade shows, independent blogs, etc.)
* Assist in the recruitment of new members
* Contribute where appropriate to documentation and code reviews, specification development, demonstration assets and other artifacts that help move OpenDataology forward

#### How to become a contributor

Being recognized as an OpenDataology contributor is done by nomination of an OpenDataology committers with a majority vote
of OpenDataology committers to confirm. 

### OpenDataology project committers

Committers are members of the OpenDataology community that have permission to change the OpenDataology content.
This may be content that they have created themselves, or has been provided by another member.
Committers also have responsibility for helping other project members with their contributions.
This includes:
* Monitoring email aliases.
* Monitoring Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).
* Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.
* Make sure that ongoing git pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.

#### How to become a committer

New committers are voted onto the committers list by the existing committers

The committers vote and if a majority agree then the requester
is added to the committers list and given write access to the git repositories.

Once confirmed, you can publicly refer to yourself as an OpenDataology committer.

#### When does a committer lose maintainer status

If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the committers per the voting process below.
Emeritus committers can rejoin the committer list through a vote of the
existing committers.

### OpenDataology leadership

The leadership of OpenDataology is granted through a vote of the OpenDataology committers.
OpenDataology is currently led by OpenDataology Core Team.

## OpenDataology on Slack

OpenDataology uses the [a Slack community](https://data-license.slack.com) to provide an ongoing dialogue between members.
This creates a recorded discussion of design decisions and discussions that complement the project meetings.

Follow the link above and register with the slack service using your email address.
Once signed in you can see all of the active slack channels.

Additional channels are added from time to time as new workgroups and discussion topics are established. 

## OpenDataology content management tools

The OpenDataology content is managed in GitHub under [https://github.com/OpenDataology/OpenDataology](https://github.com/OpenDataology/OpenDataology).
It may be developed using patches, branches from main, or forks/git pull requests.
Each change should have a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OpenDataology/OpenDataology/issues) explaining why the change is being made.
See: [CONTRIBUTING.md]

When new content proposed to the project, the person contributing is required to sign the contribution
to confirm it conforms to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

## OpenDataology project releases

The OpenDataology team aim to create regular official release of OpenDataology.

In between official releases, the latest build is also available to developers in GitHub.

## Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and committer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the committers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the committers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each committer receives one vote.
