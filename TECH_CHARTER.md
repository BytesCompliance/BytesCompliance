b.	**Composition**. The TSC is composed of **1 chairperson and 8 seats** elected as set forth below (each a “TSC Member”). The OpenDataology Core Team will appoint the initial chairperson and TSC Members. The first election will be held 6 months after the date of that initial appointment (the “Initial Election”). In the event a TSC Member resigns, a new election will be held to replace that TSC Member, where the elected replacement will serve the remainder of the resigning TSC’s Member’s term.
